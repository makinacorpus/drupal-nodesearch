# Node selector and search endpoint

From a Drupal standpoint, this module only gives a single API endpoint for
searching nodes.

Now that's being said, it also will provide 2 JavaScript UI components:

 * a dialog based selector, all custom, attachable to any input widget,
 * a select2 based autocomplete component.
